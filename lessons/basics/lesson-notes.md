## NOTES:

Just a scratch sheet for jotting down items for future lessons before the lesson is written.

<!--
- Syntax for things. Get into functions:
  ```javascript
  let foo = function foo(a,b) { return c; };
  ```
- && perhaps show some basic comparisons between JS, Php, Ruby/Python?  Just to show  how learning these things applies across multiple langages, so pay the tax once & it will return again later.
- && go back and cover how these are all the same:
  ```javascript
  let str = "Ben";
  let str = new String("Ben");
  str.charAt(0);
  str2.charAt(0);
  "Ben".charAt(0);
  ```
- prob need a set of syntax heavy constructs.  for loop, switch, while, function might be sufficient. JSON structure.  Def need to memorize & commit each to muscle memory. drill these in, will pay off exponentially!


perhaps use this to go over basic JS + the new ES6 stuff, roadmap might be doable:
