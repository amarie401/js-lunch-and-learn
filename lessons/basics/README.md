# Basics

This is migrated from a collection of gists used for the first 2 months of my L&L.

Polish & organization is likely needed.

The `lesson-*.md` files are loosely based on the [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction).  I've adjusted content & ordering to fit growing a beginner to a working knowledge of JS more quickly, sometimes reordering or omitting, intentionally looping back to revisit topics when additional information becomes more relevant.  

MDN's outline is as follows:
- Introduction
- Grammar
- Control Flow
- Loops
- Functions (and fat arrow fns)
- Expressions and operators
- Numbers and Dates
- Text
- Regex
- Indexes
- Keys
- Objects
- The Object Model
- Interators and Generators
- Metaprogramming


Additional concepts to address:
- Closures
- IIFE
- Strict mode
- Classes
  - class methods, one more way to declare a fn
  - review func declartion, expression, anonymous, method
- Other Array types (Typed Arrays)
- Maps
- Promises, etc
- Lodash & functional programming
  - immutable data vs objects
- jQuery
- Angular
- React
