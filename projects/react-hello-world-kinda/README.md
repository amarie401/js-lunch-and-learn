# React Product List

Built following the tutorial from the React [docs site here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html).

# Installation

This project was setup using yarn, but can be managed with npm as well.

```bash
yarn init
yarn add react react-dom
yarn add babel-preset-es2015
yarn add babel-preset-react
```

And then abandoned because... need better guidance on what to do next. :)


# Babel
