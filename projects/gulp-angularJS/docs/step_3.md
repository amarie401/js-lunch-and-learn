# Step 3:  Coming Soon


<!--
TODO:
- look at "what next" from step_1.md.  more or less:
- add build for sass, js
- ensure inject works for /src with all the individual files
  - gulp-inject will do this
  - the 'name' option will allow us to use named injection points
    for vendor, etc
- ensure inject works for /dist after we build/minify
- ensure we can serve both /src and /dist so that we can verify
  everything works as expected, both before and after minification!
  - either with a /dev and a /dist prefix
  - OR using ports: 3000 and 3001
    - ports may be easier, path manipulation is always a tad messy
