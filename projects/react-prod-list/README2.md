# React Product List

Built following the tutorial from the React [docs site here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html).

# Installation

This project was setup using yarn, but can be managed with npm as well.

[update]: The [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) package sure seems handy with all the bells and whistles they want you to use (browserify, babel, es6, etc etc).

```bash
yarn init
yarn add react react-dom
yarn add babel-preset-es2015
yarn add babel-preset-react
```

# Babel

- Understanding the .babelrc file [here (kinda)](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/)
