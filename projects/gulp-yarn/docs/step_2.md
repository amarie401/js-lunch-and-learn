# Step 2: Processing some JS

Last week's homework was to add some additional `.sass` files, including some `_includes.sass` and
ensure they are properly compiled.  In addition, add `autoprefixer`.  We are not going to go over
these today, so if you didn't do them, time to head back!

<!--
TODO: part 2: finish the build system
- add autoprefixer
- add concat
- perhaps do all the homework, so can less & sass? why not...
- add babel to transpile es6
- add concat to build js into a single file
- add serve  for src & dist
  - ideally with watch as well
  - use src maps to just load the /dest? not sure...
- add others from this: http://blog.rangle.io/angular-gulp-bestpractices/
- get to the point where we can start building the actual app!
- NOTE:
  - tag the repo at this point, so we can use this as a starting place for angular, react & vue.js
  - ideally can build off the same base, in branches.
